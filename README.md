# What we're up to: A demo

## A simple way to help users navigate and transfer their data between government sites, without requiring agency-to-agency data-sharing.

We're building the digital version of a user grabbing a document from one office, receiving good directions, and walking it down to the street to different office. Our approach makes it possible to get this done online in a few clicks without prior knowledge of where the docs or data are stored, and without incurring the privacy and security costs of transmitting data directly from one agency to another.

**For users:** We're trying to deliver an experience that feels like, "Do you need to get a doc from another agency? Just keep clicking "yes", and after 6-10 clicks it'll be done and you'll be back where you started and ready to move on." 

**For agencies:** We aim to help agencies deliver this user experience, *without needing a data-sharing agreement*, and with minimal integrationâ€”all an agency has to do is add links and url params to existing web pages.

## How you can help:

**We're looking for pilot partners to help test this approach.**

Weâ€™re hoping to find a situation where:

- Two systems need the same data but for compliance reasons are not connected.
- Data is transferred between the two systems via a manual processâ€”potentially even by a user downloading a file from one system and then manually uploading it to another.
- The risk of failure is fairly low; this isnâ€™t PII or mission-critical data transfer. Perhaps the users are federal employees rather than members of the public.

Can you think of a situation like this? Are you the system owner for a system thatâ€™s involved in a situation like this? If so, please contact the 10x team working on this idea: mike.gintz@gsa.gov and jim.moffet@gsa.gov
