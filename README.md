# What we're up to (demo)

Below is a demo of what data-sharing _without a data-sharing-agreement_ might look like in practice. We're building the digital version of a user grabbing a document from one office and walking it down to the street to another. Hyperlinks mean that it's possible to get this done in a few clicks without actually transmitting docs or data directly from one agency to another.

**For users,** we're trying to deliver an experience that feels like, "Do you want to get a doc from another agency? Just keep clicking "yes", after 6-10 clicks it'll be done and you'll be back where you started and ready to move on." 

**For agency partners,** we aim to help them deliver this experience to users, *without needing a data-sharing agreement*, and with minimal integration (adding links and url params to existing web pages).

10x is looking for pilot partners to help test a new idea for transferring data between systems that, we think, might avoid the need for a data sharing agreement between the system owners. Weâ€™re hoping to find a situation where:
- Two systems need the same data but for compliance reasons are not connected.
- Data is transferred between the two systems via a manual processâ€”potentially even by a user downloading a file from one system and then manually uploading it to another.
- The risk of failure is fairly low; this isnâ€™t PII or mission-critical data transfer. Perhaps the users are federal employees rather than members of the public.

Can you think of a situation like this? Are you the system owner for a system thatâ€™s involved in a situation like this? If so, please contact the 10x team working on this idea: mike.gintz@gsa.gov and jim.moffet@gsa.gov
